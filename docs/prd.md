1. Automated execution of AI-generated navigation sequences using Playwright
2. Error handling for navigation failures with recovery attempts
3. Documentation of discovered pages and functionality during navigation
4. Integration with existing analysis pipeline for newly discovered pages
5. Progress tracking for navigation plan execution with status updates
6. Safety mechanisms to stop execution if unexpected behavior detected
7. Results integration with existing page analysis and documentation system

### Story 6.3: Step 2 Feature Analysis MCP Integration

As a developer using AI development environments,
I want the sophisticated FeatureAnalyzer accessible through MCP tools,
so that I can perform detailed feature analysis on individual pages without manual orchestration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. FeatureAnalyzer (implemented in Story 3.4) exposed as `analyze_page_features()` MCP tool
2. Tool accepts page URL and content data, returns structured feature analysis
3. Analysis includes interactive elements, API integrations, and rebuild specifications
4. Batch processing support for multiple pages with progress tracking
5. Integration with existing error handling and quality validation (Story 3.6)
6. Compatibility with progress tracking system (Story 4.1) and checkpointing (Story 4.2)
7. Performance optimization through caching and concurrent processing

### Story 6.4: High-Level Workflow Orchestration Tools

As a developer using AI development environments,
I want a high-level orchestration tool that combines all existing MCP tools into intelligent workflows,
so that I can perform complete site analysis through natural conversational interactions instead of manually coordinating 15+ individual tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Single orchestration tool `analyze_legacy_site()` manages complete "URL → discovery → analysis → documentation" workflow
2. Natural language instructions translated into appropriate tool sequences
3. Progress tracking integrated throughout orchestrated workflow with unified status reporting
4. Cross-tool error recovery and intelligent retry logic with graceful degradation
5. Comprehensive result aggregation into actionable rebuild documentation
6. Support for both interactive mode (with checkpoints) and YOLO mode (fully automated)
7. Configuration propagation through all orchestrated tools (LLM selection, browser settings, etc.)

### Story 6.5: AI-Driven Site Analysis Workflow

As a developer using AI development environments,
I want an intelligent site analysis workflow that uses AI to orchestrate the complete analysis process,
so that I can get comprehensive legacy application analysis through natural conversation instead of manually coordinating multiple tools.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Single conversational command initiates complete site analysis workflow
2. AI intelligently decides analysis scope, depth, and tool selection based on site characteristics and patterns
3. Automatic handling of common site types (e-commerce, admin panels, content sites, etc.) with appropriate strategies
4. Natural language progress updates throughout analysis with context-aware messaging
5. AI-synthesized results with prioritized rebuild recommendations and executive summary
6. Adaptive analysis strategy based on site complexity, user requirements, and historical patterns
7. Full integration with existing tool ecosystem while adding conversational AI interface

### Story 6.1: AI Navigation Plan Generation

As a user,
I want AI to read page content and generate a navigation plan,
so that I can discover interactive functionality that requires specific click sequences or form interactions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. LLM analysis of page content to identify clickable elements, forms, and navigation options
2. Simple navigation plan generation: "click button X, then fill form Y, then click Z"
3. Navigation sequence documentation with clear step-by-step instructions
4. Safety checks to avoid destructive actions (delete buttons, irreversible operations)
5. Navigation plan limited to 3-5 steps maximum to keep complexity manageable
6. Integration with existing page analysis as optional enhancement
7. Configuration via `ENABLE_AI_NAVIGATION=true/false` environment variable

### Story 6.2: Navigation Plan Execution

As a user,
I want to execute AI-generated navigation plans automatically,
so that I can analyze pages and functionality that are only accessible through specific interaction sequences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Automated execution of LLM-generated navigation sequences using Playwright
2. State preservation allowing rollback to original page state after navigation analysis
3. Error handling for navigation failures with graceful fallback to original analysis
4. Navigation-discovered pages automatically added to analysis queue
5. Enhanced page analysis using context from navigation sequence (e.g., "this page reached after login")
6. Navigation execution logging for debugging and validation
7. Time limits and safety timeouts to prevent infinite navigation loops

### Story 6.3: Simple Navigation Mode Integration

As a user,
I want AI navigation to work seamlessly with existing analysis modes,
so that I can optionally enable enhanced navigation without changing my standard workflow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. AI navigation as optional step in both Interactive and YOLO modes
2. Cost estimation showing additional LLM usage for navigation planning
3. User approval required in Interactive mode before executing navigation plans
4. Automatic navigation execution in YOLO mode when enabled via configuration
5. Navigation results integrated into standard analysis documentation
6. Fallback to simple navigation when AI navigation is disabled or fails
7. Clear documentation showing which pages were discovered through AI navigation vs. standard crawling
