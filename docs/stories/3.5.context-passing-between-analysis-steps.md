# Story 3.5: Context Passing Between Analysis Steps

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** Step 2 analysis to leverage Step 1 insights,
**so that** feature analysis is informed by the broader context and purpose of each page

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Context data structure passing Step 1 results (purpose, user context, business logic) to Step 2 analysis
2. Enhanced feature analysis using contextual understanding to improve accuracy and relevance
3. Cross-referencing between content purpose and technical implementation requirements
4. Workflow dependency identification based on page context and user journey analysis
5. Priority scoring for features based on business importance identified in Step 1
6. Consistency validation between Step 1 insights and Step 2 technical findings
7. Combined analysis output showing both contextual understanding and technical specifications

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define context payload passed from ContentSummary to FeatureAnalysis workflows (AC: 1)
- [ ] Augment Step 2 prompts to include contextual highlights and user journey cues (AC: 2-4)
- [ ] Implement cross-check logic tying technical requirements back to Step 1 insights (AC: 3,6)
- [ ] Calculate priority scores blending business importance from Step 1 with complexity from Step 2 (AC: 5)
- [ ] Merge outputs into combined data structure surfaced to documentation pipelines (AC: 7)
- [ ] Flag inconsistencies between steps for manual review in diagnostics/logs (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Use data contracts outlined in `docs/architecture.md#contentsummary` and `docs/architecture.md#featureanalysis` to shape context payload.
- Reference integration goals in `docs/prd.md#story-35-context-passing-between-analysis-steps`.
- Ensure priority scoring feeds progress and planning tools from `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation`.
- Surface mismatch alerts through diagnostics so users in Interactive mode (Story 5.1) can intervene.
- Persist combined output for documentation generator per `docs/prd.md#story-43-structured-documentation-generation`.

### Testing
- Unit test context payload construction ensuring all Step 1 fields transfer correctly.
- Simulate divergent Step 1/Step 2 results to verify inconsistency flags and priority scoring.
- Integration test combined output to confirm documentation generation receives both context and technical data.
