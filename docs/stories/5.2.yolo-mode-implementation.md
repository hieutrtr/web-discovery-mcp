# Story 5.2: YOLO Mode Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** fully automated analysis without interruptions,
**so that** I can process large websites efficiently when I trust the automated analysis quality

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MCP tool `yolo_analysis` starts complete automated analysis with minimal user input
2. Predefined configuration for model selection, page processing order, and error handling
3. Automated decision-making for all analysis parameters without user intervention
4. Background processing with periodic status updates but no blocking user prompts
5. Automatic error recovery and retry logic for failed pages without user intervention
6. Bulk processing optimization for analyzing entire website or large page sets
7. Completion notification with summary statistics and analysis location

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `yolo_analysis` entrypoint initializing configuration presets and queue (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Default analysis parameters using Story 3.2 configuration settings (AC: 2,3)
- [ ] Integrate progress updates from Story 4.1 without prompting user (AC: 4)
- [ ] Reuse retry/fallback handlers from Story 3.6 for automated recovery (AC: 5)
- [ ] Optimize batching/concurrency respecting session manager limits (AC: 6)
- [ ] Emit completion summary with metrics and artifact paths (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow requirements in `docs/prd.md#story-52-yolo-mode-implementation`.
- Load default behavior from configuration system (`docs/stories/1.3.basic-configuration-management.md`).
- Ensure automation respects concurrency controls in `docs/stories/2.1.playwright-browser-session-management.md`.
- Leverage progress tracker and documentation outputs (`docs/stories/4.1.real-time-progress-tracking-system.md`, `docs/stories/4.3.structured-documentation-generation.md`).
- Trigger completion notifications using MCP resources or console logs consistent with UX guidance in Epic 5.

### Testing
- Unit test configuration preset loading and parameter application.
- Integration test full YOLO run on sample site with mocked LLM/browser services.
- Stress test bulk processing to validate throughput and recovery behavior.
