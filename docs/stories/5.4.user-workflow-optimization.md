# Story 5.4: User Workflow Optimization

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer using AI development tools,
**I want** streamlined workflows that integrate naturally with my development environment,
**so that** legacy analysis feels like a natural part of my rebuild project workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single-command analysis initiation from AI development environment with sensible defaults
2. Context-aware suggestions based on project type and discovered website characteristics
3. Intelligent page prioritization recommendations based on complexity and importance
4. Workflow templates for common legacy analysis scenarios (e-commerce, CMS, business applications)
5. Integration with project documentation workflow for seamless result incorporation
6. Quick access to analysis results through MCP resources during development
7. Contextual help and guidance accessible throughout the analysis workflow

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Provide simplified command wrappers or aliases for common analysis flows (AC: 1)
- [ ] Analyze project metadata and discovery outputs to suggest next actions (AC: 2)
- [ ] Rank pages using complexity scores from FeatureAnalysis + business importance (AC: 3)
- [ ] Deliver scenario templates with preconfigured settings for key use cases (AC: 4)
- [ ] Hook documentation outputs into project docs per Story 4.4 (AC: 5)
- [ ] Expose quick-access MCP resources and commands for results (AC: 6)
- [ ] Implement contextual help prompts referencing relevant docs and tips (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Align enhancements with `docs/prd.md#story-54-user-workflow-optimization` goals.
- Use data from documentation generator and progress tracker to drive suggestions.
- Prioritization logic should leverage scores from `docs/stories/3.5.context-passing-between-analysis-steps.md` and FeatureAnalysis complexity.
- Scenario templates should live alongside configuration assets under docs/architecture tech preferences if referenced.
- Help content should link to MCP commands and documentation inside `docs/web_discovery` outputs.

### Testing
- Unit test prioritization heuristics and template selection logic.
- Integration test CLI/command wrappers to ensure they launch correct workflows.
- UX regression tests verifying help prompts surface expected guidance paths.
