# Story 6.3: Simple Navigation Mode Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** AI navigation to work seamlessly with existing analysis modes,
**so that** I can optionally enable enhanced navigation without changing my standard workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
1. AI navigation as optional step in both Interactive and YOLO modes
2. Cost estimation showing additional LLM usage for navigation planning
3. User approval required in Interactive mode before executing navigation plans
4. Automatic navigation execution in YOLO mode when enabled via configuration
5. Navigation results integrated into standard analysis documentation
6. Fallback to simple navigation when AI navigation is disabled or fails
7. Clear documentation showing which pages were discovered through AI navigation vs. standard crawling

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Insert navigation option into interactive and YOLO workflows when feature enabled (AC: 1,4)
- [ ] Display incremental cost estimates using Story 3.2 metrics before running navigation (AC: 2)
- [ ] Require explicit approval in interactive flow prior to execution (AC: 3)
- [ ] Record navigation-derived artifacts in documentation and metadata (AC: 5,7)
- [ ] Fallback to default behavior on errors or when disabled (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Meet requirements in `docs/prd.md#story-63-simple-navigation-mode-integration`.
- Ensure cost estimation leverages the same budgeting engine as interactive workflows (`docs/stories/5.1.interactive-mode-implementation.md`).
- YOLO integration should align with automation pipeline in `docs/stories/5.2.yolo-mode-implementation.md`.
- Document navigation attribution in analysis report per `docs/stories/4.3.structured-documentation-generation.md` and metadata in Story 4.4.
- Fallback logic should reuse error handling patterns from `docs/stories/3.6.analysis-quality-and-error-handling.md`.

### Testing
- Unit test mode gating logic ensuring feature toggled correctly for both modes.
- Integration test interactive approval workflow with navigation enabled/disabled.
- Verify documentation metadata differentiates navigation-discovered pages via regression tests.
