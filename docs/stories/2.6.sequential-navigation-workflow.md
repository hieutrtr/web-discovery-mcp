# Story 2.6: Sequential Navigation Workflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to analyze multiple pages in a systematic sequence,
**so that** I can efficiently process an entire website or selected page subset.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MCP tool `analyze_page_list` processes multiple URLs in specified order
2. Navigation queue management with pause, resume, and skip functionality
3. Progress tracking with current page, completed count, and estimated time remaining
4. Error recovery and continuation for failed page loads or analysis errors
5. Resource management between page analyses to prevent browser session degradation
6. Checkpoint creation for resuming interrupted analyses from last successful page
7. Batch processing optimization to minimize browser session overhead

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `analyze_page_list` orchestrator (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Accept ordered URL list and coordinate session reuse (AC: 1)
- [ ] Build navigation queue with control actions (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Support pause, resume, skip commands exposed via MCP interface (AC: 2)
- [ ] Provide progress tracking telemetry (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Emit current page, counts, ETA updates leveraging structlog and resource updates (AC: 3)
- [ ] Handle errors and retries (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Capture failures, retry limited times, and continue queue safely (AC: 4)
- [ ] Manage resources between analyses (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Reset/cleanup contexts per page using session manager hooks (AC: 5)
- [ ] Create checkpoint persistence (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Store progress state in project metadata for resume support (AC: 6)
- [ ] Optimize batch processing (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Group pages to reuse browser contexts efficiently while respecting isolation (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Leverage project organization from Story 1.5 for storing checkpoints and progress metadata.
- Integrate with diagnostics from Story 1.2 to surface queue status and any failures.
- Ensure orchestrator composes previously built functionality (navigation, interactions, network monitoring, data collection) while remaining extensible for Epic 3 LLM pipeline.
- Respect concurrency limits from Story 2.1; queue should coordinate with session manager semaphores.
- Progress telemetry should feed future Epic 4 dashboards, so structure data for reuse.

### Testing
- Integration tests simulating multi-page analysis with mocked Playwright to validate queue control and checkpointing.
- Unit tests for progress estimation and error handling logic using deterministic fixtures.
- Resilience tests ensuring resume-from-checkpoint works after simulated interruption.
