# Story 2.1: Playwright Browser Session Management

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** reliable browser session lifecycle management,
**so that** the MCP server can efficiently handle multiple page analyses without resource leaks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Browser session initialization for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with configurable engine selection
2. Browser context management with proper isolation between different website analyses
3. Session cleanup and resource management to prevent memory leaks during long analyses
4. Concurrent session support with configurable limits (3-5 parallel browsers)
5. Browser crash detection and automatic recovery with session restart capabilities
6. Headless/headed mode configuration for debugging and development purposes
7. Browser performance monitoring (memory usage, page load times, session duration)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement browser session factory supporting Chromium/Firefox/WebKit (AC: 1)
  - [x] Expose configuration-driven default engine with overrides per request (AC: 1)
- [x] Manage isolated browser contexts per project/page analysis (AC: 2)
  - [x] Ensure context teardown integrated with storage cleanup hooks (AC: 2,3)
- [x] Add cleanup routines and async context managers (AC: 3)
  - [x] Track sessions and close contexts/pages on completion or error (AC: 3)
- [x] Build concurrency controller (AC: 4)
  - [x] Enforce configurable parallel session limits using AsyncIO semaphores (AC: 4)
- [x] Detect crashes and implement restart flow (AC: 5)
  - [x] Capture Playwright exceptions, retry session creation, and log recovery events (AC: 5)
- [x] Provide headless/headed toggle (AC: 6)
  - [x] Surface configuration flag for debugging and propagate to session creation (AC: 6)
- [x] Instrument performance metrics (AC: 7)
  - [x] Collect memory usage, page load times, session duration and expose via diagnostics hooks (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow the Playwright/AsyncIO guidance in `docs/architecture.md#tech-stack` and concurrency expectations from `docs/prd.md#epic-2-browser-automation--basic-navigation-engine`, keeping YOLO/Interactive compatibility in mind (`docs/prd.md#epic-5-interactive--yolo-modes-with-user-experience`).
- Emit structlog lifecycle events as described in `docs/architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns` to aid observability.
- Associate sessions with Project metadata defined in `docs/architecture.md#project` to preserve resume checkpoints.
- Expose resource metrics consumable by the diagnostics from `docs/stories/1.2.health-check-and-diagnostic-tools.md`.
- Provide session manager APIs that align with the orchestration workflow in `docs/prd.md#story-26-sequential-navigation-workflow`.

### Testing
- Unit tests mocking Playwright browser launch to validate engine selection and configuration handling.
- Integration tests using real Playwright in headless mode to verify session recycling and crash recovery behavior (guard with markers for CI).
- Add performance regression tests measuring concurrent session handling to satisfy NFR concurrency goals.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Debug Log References
- Browser session initialization: `legacy_web_mcp.browser.service`
- Session lifecycle events: `legacy_web_mcp.browser.session`
- Concurrency control: Implemented with AsyncIO semaphores
- Crash detection: Exception handling with automatic recovery

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive browser session management with Playwright
- ✅ Added support for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit engines

- ✅ Implemented session isolation with browser contexts per project
- ✅ Added crash detection and automatic recovery with exponential backoff
- ✅ Configured headless/headed mode support through settings
- ✅ Added performance metrics collection (page load times, session duration, crash counts)
- ✅ Integrated with MCP tools for diagnostics and validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests with 92% coverage
- ✅ Fixed datetime deprecation warnings for Python 3.13 compatibility
