# Story 6.1: AI Navigation Plan Generation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** AI to read page content and generate a navigation plan,
**so that** I can discover interactive functionality that requires specific click sequences or form interactions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LLM analysis of page content to identify clickable elements, forms, and navigation options
2. Simple navigation plan generation: "click button X, then fill form Y, then click Z"
3. Navigation sequence documentation with clear step-by-step instructions
4. Safety checks to avoid destructive actions (delete buttons, irreversible operations)
5. Navigation plan limited to 3-5 steps maximum to keep complexity manageable
6. Integration with existing page analysis as optional enhancement
7. Configuration via `ENABLE_AI_NAVIGATION=true/false` environment variable

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Extend LLM engine to request navigation plans using page analysis inputs (AC: 1-3)
- [ ] Filter actions to exclude destructive operations using heuristics from interaction logs (AC: 4)
- [ ] Clamp plan length to configurable max steps (default 3-5) (AC: 5)
- [ ] Attach generated plans to page artifacts without impacting core workflow (AC: 6)
- [ ] Add configuration flag to enable/disable AI navigation with defaults (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow requirements in `docs/prd.md#story-61-ai-navigation-plan-generation`.
- Use interaction data collected in `docs/stories/2.4.basic-page-interaction-automation.md` and FeatureAnalysis to inform prompts.
- Apply safety guidelines from `docs/architecture.md#security` to avoid destructive actions.
- Store plans alongside page data for documentation consumption (`docs/stories/4.3.structured-documentation-generation.md`).
- Respect configuration precedence rules in `docs/stories/1.3.basic-configuration-management.md`.

### Testing
- Unit test plan generation filters ensuring destructive actions are removed.
- Mock LLM responses to validate step formatting and length limits.
- Integration test toggling configuration flag to confirm optional behavior.
