# Story 1.5: Project Organization and File Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** organized project folders for analysis results,
**so that** I can easily navigate and manage multiple website analysis sessions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic project folder creation based on website domain and timestamp
2. Standardized folder structure: `/project-name/discovery/`, `/project-name/analysis/`, `/project-name/reports/`
3. URL inventory saved as structured JSON/YAML with human-readable organization
4. Metadata tracking: analysis start time, configuration used, discovered URL count
5. Project listing functionality to view and resume previous analysis sessions
6. Clean-up utilities for managing disk space and old analysis data

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement project folder initializer (AC: 1,2)
  - [ ] Generate domain + timestamp based identifiers following architecture naming guidance (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create discovery/analysis/reports subdirectories consistently (AC: 2)
- [ ] Persist URL inventory in structured format (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Serialize discovery output into JSON/YAML with grouping by section (AC: 3)
- [ ] Record project metadata (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Store metadata file containing timestamps, configuration snapshot, counts (AC: 4)
- [ ] Build project listing capability (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Enumerate existing project folders, summarizing status and metadata (AC: 5)
- [ ] Provide cleanup utilities (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement commands to archive or delete old projects with confirmation safeguards (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Follow the file-based storage guidance in `docs/architecture.md#high-level-architecture` and the checkpoint expectations from `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation`.
- Use dataclass/pydantic models as recommended in `docs/architecture.md#tech-stack` and the data modeling guidance in `docs/architecture.md#data-models`.
- Align file naming with the Project and Page entities defined in `docs/architecture.md#project` and `docs/architecture.md#page`.
- Design cleanup utilities with safeguards consistent with the security practices in `docs/architecture.md#security`.
- Expose metadata retrieval hooks that will feed the progress dashboards outlined in `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation`.

### Testing
- Unit tests for folder creation and metadata serialization using temporary directories via pytest fixtures.
- Integration tests verifying discover_website output persists correctly into new structure.
- Include cleanup utility tests ensuring confirmation workflows prevent unintended deletion.
