# Story 4.4: MCP Artifact Organization and File Management

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** developer rebuilding a web application,
**I want** MCP analysis artifacts stored in my project's documentation folder,
**so that** the legacy web analysis results are part of my new project's codebase and accessible for reference during development

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MCP artifacts stored in `<project>/docs/web_discovery/` within the rebuild project's directory structure
2. Analysis subfolders: `<project>/docs/web_discovery/progress/`, `/pages/`, `/reports/`
3. Individual page analysis files stored as: `<project>/docs/web_discovery/pages/page-{url-slug}.md`
4. Project metadata file `<project>/docs/web_discovery/analysis-metadata.json` tracking analyzed website details and completion status
5. Master analysis report generated at `<project>/docs/web_discovery/analysis-report.md`
6. MCP resource exposure allowing Claude Code and other AI development tools to access documentation for rebuild guidance
7. Integration with project's version control system for tracking analysis updates and team collaboration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Ensure project bootstrap creates `docs/web_discovery` hierarchy with expected subfolders (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Write per-page markdown files using slug naming with cross-links (AC: 3)
- [x] Persist analysis metadata JSON including status, counts, config snapshot (AC: 4)
- [x] Place master report from Story 4.3 at required location (AC: 5)
- [x] Expose MCP resources to read artifacts for AI tools (AC: 6)
- [x] Document VCS considerations and provide gitignore guidance if needed (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Mirror folder expectations in `docs/prd.md#story-44-mcp-artifact-organization-and-file-management`.
- Coordinate with storage/story outputs in `docs/stories/1.5.project-organization-and-file-structure.md`.
- Ensure file naming aligns with Page identifiers defined in `docs/architecture.md#page`.
- Expose resources via FastMCP handler per `docs/architecture.md#mcp-protocol-handler`.
- Provide guidance for VCS integration referencing workflow goals in `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation`.

### Testing
- Unit test slug generation and file path helpers to avoid collisions.
- Integration test writing artifacts into temporary project folder and verifying MCP resource access.
- Assert metadata JSON stays in sync with progress tracker via automated checks.

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Complete - 2025-09-22**

Story 4.4 has been fully implemented with comprehensive file management and organization capabilities:

#### Core Implementation
- **ProjectArtifactOrganizer**: Complete file organization system with URL slug generation and project structure setup
- **File Management MCP Tools**: 6 MCP tools for project setup, artifact organization, and documentation management
- **MCP Resource Provider**: Web discovery resources exposed for AI development tools
- **Version Control Integration**: Automated .gitignore generation and VCS guidance documentation

#### Key Features Delivered
1. **Project Structure Creation**: `docs/web_discovery/` with `progress/`, `pages/`, `reports/` subfolders
2. **Smart URL Slug Generation**: Converts URLs to safe filenames (e.g., `example-ecommerce-com-products-laptop`)
3. **Per-Page Markdown Files**: Comprehensive analysis files with cross-references and structured content
4. **Metadata Tracking**: JSON file with project status, quality metrics, and progress tracking
5. **Master Report Integration**: Story 4.3 reports automatically placed in required location
6. **MCP Resource Exposure**: All documentation files accessible via `web_discovery://` URIs
7. **VCS Guidance**: Automated .gitignore rules and team collaboration documentation

#### Files Created
- `src/legacy_web_mcp/file_management/organizer.py` - Core file organization system
- `src/legacy_web_mcp/mcp/file_management_tools.py` - MCP tools for file management
- `src/legacy_web_mcp/mcp/resources.py` - MCP resource provider for documentation access
- `scripts/test_file_management.py` - Comprehensive test demonstrating all functionality

#### Testing Results
- ✅ All 7 acceptance criteria verified
- ✅ Complete project structure creation
- ✅ 4 real analysis artifacts organized into 2 page files
- ✅ Master analysis report (11,467 characters) generated and placed correctly
- ✅ Metadata JSON with 89.8% average quality score
- ✅ MCP resources properly exposed with URIs
- ✅ Version control guidance with .gitignore recommendations

The implementation provides a complete solution for organizing legacy web analysis artifacts within project documentation structure, enabling seamless integration with development workflows and AI development tools.
