# Story 4.4: MCP Artifact Organization and File Management

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer rebuilding a web application,
**I want** MCP analysis artifacts stored in my project's documentation folder,
**so that** the legacy web analysis results are part of my new project's codebase and accessible for reference during development

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MCP artifacts stored in `<project>/docs/web_discovery/` within the rebuild project's directory structure
2. Analysis subfolders: `<project>/docs/web_discovery/progress/`, `/pages/`, `/reports/`
3. Individual page analysis files stored as: `<project>/docs/web_discovery/pages/page-{url-slug}.md`
4. Project metadata file `<project>/docs/web_discovery/analysis-metadata.json` tracking analyzed website details and completion status
5. Master analysis report generated at `<project>/docs/web_discovery/analysis-report.md`
6. MCP resource exposure allowing Claude Code and other AI development tools to access documentation for rebuild guidance
7. Integration with project's version control system for tracking analysis updates and team collaboration

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Ensure project bootstrap creates `docs/web_discovery` hierarchy with expected subfolders (AC: 1,2)
- [ ] Write per-page markdown files using slug naming with cross-links (AC: 3)
- [ ] Persist analysis metadata JSON including status, counts, config snapshot (AC: 4)
- [ ] Place master report from Story 4.3 at required location (AC: 5)
- [ ] Expose MCP resources to read artifacts for AI tools (AC: 6)
- [ ] Document VCS considerations and provide gitignore guidance if needed (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Mirror folder expectations in `docs/prd.md#story-44-mcp-artifact-organization-and-file-management`.
- Coordinate with storage/story outputs in `docs/stories/1.5.project-organization-and-file-structure.md`.
- Ensure file naming aligns with Page identifiers defined in `docs/architecture.md#page`.
- Expose resources via FastMCP handler per `docs/architecture.md#mcp-protocol-handler`.
- Provide guidance for VCS integration referencing workflow goals in `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation`.

### Testing
- Unit test slug generation and file path helpers to avoid collisions.
- Integration test writing artifacts into temporary project folder and verifying MCP resource access.
- Assert metadata JSON stays in sync with progress tracker via automated checks.
