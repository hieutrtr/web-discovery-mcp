# Story 3.3: Step 1 - Content Summarization Analysis

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** LLM-powered content analysis for each page,
**so that** I understand the page's purpose, context, and role within the overall application workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LLM analysis of page content to identify purpose, target users, and business context
2. Content hierarchy analysis including main sections, navigation patterns, and information architecture
3. User journey context identification showing entry points, exit paths, and workflow integration
4. Business logic overview extraction from page behavior and interactive elements
5. Structured output format capturing key insights in consistent, machine-readable format
6. Analysis confidence scoring to identify pages needing additional review
7. Processing time optimization targeting 60-90 seconds per page for Step 1 analysis

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Construct Step 1 prompt templates ingesting page artifacts from Stories 2.2/2.5 (AC: 1-4)
- [ ] Integrate summarization call into LLM engine using provider abstraction from Story 3.1 (AC: 1-4)
- [ ] Parse LLM output into `ContentSummary` model with strict schema validation (AC: 5)
- [ ] Derive navigation role and user journey metadata from summarized content (AC: 2,3)
- [ ] Compute confidence scoring based on LLM metadata and heuristic checks (AC: 6)
- [ ] Instrument execution timing and optimize batching/streaming to hit 60-90s target (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow `docs/prd.md#story-33-step-1-content-summarization-analysis` for scope of insights to capture.
- Map parsed output to `ContentSummary` attributes defined in `docs/architecture.md#contentsummary`.
- Reuse page content, DOM, and interaction artifacts from `docs/stories/2.2.page-navigation-and-content-extraction.md` and `docs/stories/2.5.page-analysis-data-collection.md`.
- Apply LLM prompt design patterns from `docs/architecture.md#llm-integration-engine` to reduce hallucination risk.
- Log summarization metrics with structlog so progress tracking in `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation` can consume them.

### Testing
- Unit test response parsing and schema validation using curated fixture outputs.
- Use mocked LLM responses to verify confidence scoring and navigation role deductions.
- Measure execution timing in integration tests to ensure average runtime stays within target window.
