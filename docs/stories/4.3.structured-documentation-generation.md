# Story 4.3: Structured Documentation Generation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**I want** comprehensive, organized documentation of analysis results,
**so that** I can use the insights for project planning, scoping, and technical specifications

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Master analysis report combining all page analyses into cohesive project documentation
2. Executive summary section highlighting key findings, complexity assessment, and rebuild recommendations
3. Per-page analysis sections with content summaries, feature lists, and technical requirements
4. API integration summary documenting all discovered endpoints, data flows, and external dependencies
5. Technical specification sections suitable for architect and developer consumption
6. Business logic documentation capturing workflows, user journeys, and functional requirements
7. Structured markdown output with consistent formatting, table of contents, and cross-references

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design documentation assembler consuming Page analysis artifacts from Epic 3 (AC: 1,3,7)
- [ ] Generate executive summary using aggregated metrics and priority scores (AC: 2)
- [ ] Produce per-page sections combining ContentSummary and FeatureAnalysis data (AC: 3)
- [ ] Compile API integration appendix leveraging data from Story 2.3 (AC: 4)
- [ ] Include technical specification templates aligned with architecture standards (AC: 5)
- [ ] Document business logic and workflows extracted during Step 1/Step 2 (AC: 6)
- [ ] Create markdown with TOC, anchors, and cross-links while maintaining formatting consistency (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow reporting goals in `docs/prd.md#story-43-structured-documentation-generation`.
- Use output locations established in `docs/stories/1.5.project-organization-and-file-structure.md` and Story 4.4.
- Incorporate page models from `docs/architecture.md#page`, `docs/architecture.md#contentsummary`, and `docs/architecture.md#featureanalysis`.
- Include complexity/cost insights aligned with non-functional targets in `docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements`.
- Ensure markdown structure supports MCP resource access described in `docs/prd.md#story-44-mcp-artifact-organization-and-file-management`.

### Testing
- Unit test markdown generation helpers for TOC, anchors, and section formatting.
- Snapshot test sample reports to guard against unintended formatting regressions.
- Integration test full pipeline from page analysis inputs to final report file.
