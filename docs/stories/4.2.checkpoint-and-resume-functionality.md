# Story 4.2: Checkpoint and Resume Functionality

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to pause and resume analysis sessions,
**so that** I can handle interruptions without losing completed work or restarting entire website analyses

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic checkpoint creation after each completed page analysis
2. MCP tool `pause_analysis` safely stops current analysis and saves state
3. MCP tool `resume_analysis` continues from last checkpoint with proper state restoration
4. Manual checkpoint creation capability for user-initiated save points
5. Checkpoint data integrity validation ensuring resumable state consistency
6. Recovery from unexpected shutdowns using the most recent valid checkpoint
7. Cleanup utilities for managing checkpoint storage and preventing disk space issues

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Persist checkpoints after each completed page containing progress, queue, and context (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement `pause_analysis` tool that drains current tasks and writes safe checkpoint (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement `resume_analysis` restoring state, sessions, and remaining queue (AC: 3)
- [ ] Add manual checkpoint command leveraging same persistence routines (AC: 4)
- [ ] Validate checkpoint schema/version before loading; reject corrupt files gracefully (AC: 5)
- [ ] Auto-recover on startup by loading latest valid checkpoint when analysis incomplete (AC: 6)
- [ ] Provide cleanup utilities to archive or delete stale checkpoints with safeguards (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Store checkpoints under project metadata per `docs/stories/1.5.project-organization-and-file-structure.md` and `docs/architecture.md#project`.
- Align functionality with requirements in `docs/prd.md#story-42-checkpoint-and-resume-functionality`.
- Ensure pausing coordinates with session manager from `docs/stories/2.1.playwright-browser-session-management.md` to release resources.
- Checkpoint format should include Step 1/Step 2 partial results for analysis continuity (see `docs/stories/3.5.context-passing-between-analysis-steps.md`).
- Surface checkpoint status through diagnostics (Story 1.2) so users can audit saved states.

### Testing
- Unit test checkpoint serialization/deserialization with versioning edge cases.
- Integration test pause/resume flow simulating mid-analysis interruptions.
- Fault-injection tests verifying corrupted checkpoints are detected and recovered safely.
