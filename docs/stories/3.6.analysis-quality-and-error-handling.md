# Story 3.6: Analysis Quality and Error Handling

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** robust error handling and quality validation for LLM analysis,
**so that** the system provides reliable results and graceful failure recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LLM response validation ensuring complete, structured output meeting analysis requirements
2. Retry logic for incomplete or malformed LLM responses with different model fallback
3. Quality scoring based on analysis completeness, specificity, and technical detail level
4. Error categorization and logging for debugging analysis failures and improving prompts
5. Partial result preservation when analysis fails mid-process to avoid losing completed work
6. Analysis confidence indicators helping users identify pages needing manual review
7. Debugging tools for inspecting LLM inputs, outputs, and decision rationale

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement schema validators for Step 1 and Step 2 responses with descriptive errors (AC: 1)
- [ ] Integrate retry/fallback strategy leveraging Story 3.2 configuration and Story 3.1 providers (AC: 2)
- [ ] Compute quality scores combining completeness heuristics and LLM confidence (AC: 3,6)
- [ ] Classify errors using architecture error codes and log via structlog (AC: 4)
- [ ] Persist partial analysis artifacts for resumption and debugging (AC: 5)
- [ ] Expose debugging interface/resource showing prompts, responses, and rationale metadata (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow error handling strategy from `docs/architecture.md#error-handling-strategy` and retry policy in `docs/architecture.md#error-handling-patterns`.
- Leverage provider fallback chain defined in `docs/prd.md#story-32-configuration-based-model-selection`.
- Quality/confidence scoring should augment metrics consumed by diagnostics (`docs/stories/1.2.health-check-and-diagnostic-tools.md`).
- Ensure partial result persistence aligns with checkpointing approach in `docs/prd.md#story-42-checkpoint-and-resume-functionality`.
- Provide debugging hooks accessible in Interactive mode per `docs/prd.md#story-51-interactive-mode-implementation`.

### Testing
- Unit test validators with valid/invalid payload fixtures to ensure precise error messaging.
- Simulate provider failures to confirm retry and fallback chains behave as expected.
- Test partial result persistence and debugging outputs using integration tests with stubbed failures.
