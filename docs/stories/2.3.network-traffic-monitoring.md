# Story 2.3: Network Traffic Monitoring

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to capture network requests and API calls during page navigation,
**so that** I can understand the backend integrations and data flows of legacy applications.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Network request interception and logging for all HTTP/HTTPS traffic during page loads
2. API endpoint identification and categorization (REST, GraphQL, SOAP, custom protocols)
3. Request/response data capture including headers, methods, payloads, and response codes
4. Network timing analysis (DNS lookup, connection time, response time)
5. Third-party service identification and external dependency mapping
6. Network traffic filtering to focus on relevant application requests vs. assets
7. Structured output format for network data suitable for analysis and documentation

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Enable Playwright network interception within session manager (AC: 1)
  - [x] Capture request/response lifecycle events for navigation sessions (AC: 1)
- [x] Classify endpoints (AC: 2)
  - [x] Inspect URLs and payloads to label REST/GraphQL/SOAP/custom (AC: 2)
- [x] Record request/response details (AC: 3)
  - [x] Persist headers, methods, payload snippets, status codes securely (AC: 3)
- [x] Calculate timing metrics (AC: 4)
  - [x] Track DNS lookup, connection, response durations leveraging Playwright timing hooks (AC: 4)
- [x] Detect third-party services (AC: 5)
  - [x] Flag hosts outside primary domain and annotate dependency roles (AC: 5)
- [x] Implement filtering rules (AC: 6)
  - [x] Distinguish core application APIs vs. static assets with configurable filters (AC: 6)
- [x] Serialize structured output (AC: 7)
  - [x] Store per-page network report in JSON aligning with analysis documentation format (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Structure network output to match the Page model and LLM pipeline planned in `docs/prd.md#epic-3-llm-integration--two-step-analysis-pipeline`.
- Apply the data-handling safeguards in `docs/architecture.md#security` to redact sensitive payloads.
- Surface capture status so progress dashboards in `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation` can consume it.
- Make filter thresholds configurable per the scalability expectations in `docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements`.
- Write artifacts under the analysis folder using the identifiers established in `docs/stories/2.2.page-navigation-and-content-extraction.md` and `docs/stories/1.5.project-organization-and-file-structure.md`.

### Testing
- Unit tests for endpoint classification and filtering logic using crafted request objects.
- Integration tests with mocked Playwright events or local proxy server to ensure capture accuracy.
- Include regression test verifying structured JSON schema remains backward compatible.
