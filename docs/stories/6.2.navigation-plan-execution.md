# Story 6.2: Navigation Plan Execution

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to execute AI-generated navigation plans automatically,
**so that** I can analyze pages and functionality that are only accessible through specific interaction sequences

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Automated execution of LLM-generated navigation sequences using Playwright
2. State preservation allowing rollback to original page state after navigation analysis
3. Error handling for navigation failures with graceful fallback to original analysis
4. Navigation-discovered pages automatically added to analysis queue
5. Enhanced page analysis using context from navigation sequence (e.g., "this page reached after login")
6. Navigation execution logging for debugging and validation
7. Time limits and safety timeouts to prevent infinite navigation loops

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Parse navigation plan and execute actions via session manager/interaction helpers (AC: 1)
- [ ] Snapshot initial state and restore after plan completes or fails (AC: 2)
- [ ] Handle errors with retries or fallback to standard analysis path (AC: 3)
- [ ] Queue newly discovered pages for analysis with metadata describing origin (AC: 4,5)
- [ ] Log execution steps and outcomes for diagnostics (AC: 6)
- [ ] Enforce max duration and step limits to avoid loops (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Implement behavior per `docs/prd.md#story-62-navigation-plan-execution`.
- Reuse interaction automation utilities from `docs/stories/2.4.basic-page-interaction-automation.md` and session management from Story 2.1.
- Capture navigation context for documentation/pipeline consumption (`docs/stories/4.3.structured-documentation-generation.md`).
- Ensure state rollback leverages Playwright context isolation described in `docs/architecture.md#browser-automation-service`.
- Respect safety/time limits aligned with performance targets in `docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements`.

### Testing
- Unit test plan execution parser with varied action sequences.
- Integration test navigation on mock site verifying rollback and new page discovery behavior.
- Timeout tests ensuring long-running plans abort safely without resource leaks.
