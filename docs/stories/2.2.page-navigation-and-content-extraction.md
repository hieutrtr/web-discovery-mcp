# Story 2.2: Page Navigation and Content Extraction

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the system to navigate to discovered pages and extract their content,
**so that** I can analyze the structure and functionality of each page.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. MCP tool `navigate_to_page` accepts URL and returns successful navigation confirmation
2. Page content extraction including HTML source, page title, meta information, and visible text
3. Screenshot capture functionality for visual documentation and debugging
4. Page load timeout handling with configurable limits and retry mechanisms
5. JavaScript execution and DOM ready state detection for dynamic content
6. Error handling for broken links, redirects, and access-denied scenarios
7. Basic page metadata collection (load time, response status, content size)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement `navigate_to_page` tool using session manager (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Validate URL input and reuse security sanitization utilities (AC: 1)
- [ ] Build content extraction routines (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Capture HTML, title, meta tags, visible text summary (AC: 2)
- [ ] Add screenshot capture pipeline (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Store images within project analysis folder with consistent naming (AC: 3)
- [ ] Handle navigation timeouts and retries (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Configurable timeout values and limited retries with logging (AC: 4)
- [ ] Wait for DOM readiness/dynamic content (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Use Playwright wait conditions for network idle or specific selectors (AC: 5)
- [ ] Implement robust error handling (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Detect redirects, HTTP errors, and access denials with actionable messages (AC: 6)
- [ ] Collect basic metadata (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Measure load times, response code, content size and persist with page data (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Store artifacts under `/analysis/` following `docs/stories/1.5.project-organization-and-file-structure.md` and the layout defined in `docs/architecture.md#project`.
- Respect headless/headed toggles surfaced in `docs/stories/2.1.playwright-browser-session-management.md`.
- Correlate navigation attempts with session IDs using structlog per `docs/architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns`.
- Expose extensibility points that the monitoring in `docs/stories/2.3.network-traffic-monitoring.md` and data collectors in `docs/stories/2.5.page-analysis-data-collection.md` can consume.
- Serialize outputs to match the Page model schema in `docs/architecture.md#page` for downstream LLM processing.

### Testing
- Unit tests for extraction utilities using saved HTML fixtures to confirm parsing logic.
- Integration tests with Playwright hitting controlled local test server to validate navigation, screenshots, and metadata collection.
- Include negative tests for timeouts and error scenarios ensuring graceful messaging.
