# Story 5.5: Error Handling and User Feedback

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** clear feedback and error handling during analysis,
**so that** I understand what's happening and can resolve issues without technical debugging

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Clear, actionable error messages with specific remediation steps for common failures
2. Progress indicators showing current activity, completion status, and estimated remaining time
3. Warning notifications for potential issues (high costs, long processing times, site access problems)
4. User-friendly status messages replacing technical logs during normal operation
5. Recovery suggestions when analysis encounters problems or unexpected website behavior
6. Feedback collection mechanism for improving analysis quality and user experience
7. Help system accessible through MCP prompts providing guidance for common questions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Standardize error messages with remediation guidance leveraging diagnostics knowledge base (AC: 1,5)
- [ ] Display progress indicators sourced from Story 4.1 in user-facing prompts (AC: 2)
- [ ] Emit warnings for cost/time/site issues using metrics from Stories 3.2 and 4.1 (AC: 3)
- [ ] Replace raw logs with friendly status summaries while preserving debug logs (AC: 4)
- [ ] Offer recovery options (retry, skip, view docs) when failures occur (AC: 5)
- [ ] Capture user feedback and store in telemetry or issue log (AC: 6)
- [ ] Expose `help` prompts linking to documentation and FAQs (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Derive UX expectations from `docs/prd.md#story-55-error-handling-and-user-feedback`.
- Reuse diagnostics capabilities (`docs/stories/1.2.health-check-and-diagnostic-tools.md`) for remediation hints.
- Integrate with progress tracker for consistent indicators (`docs/stories/4.1.real-time-progress-tracking-system.md`).
- Ensure warning thresholds align with budget and performance NFRs in `docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements`.
- Log feedback to a structured location that can be surfaced in future analytics.

### Testing
- Unit test message formatting and remediation mapping for key error types.
- Integration test failure scenarios to confirm user prompts present correct options.
- Collect usability feedback via scripted tests ensuring help system accessible at each stage.
