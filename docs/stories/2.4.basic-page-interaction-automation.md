# Story 2.4: Basic Page Interaction Automation

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the system to perform basic interactions with page elements,
**so that** I can discover functionality that's only visible after user interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Element detection and interaction for common UI components (buttons, links, forms, dropdowns)
2. Safe form interaction with sample data to trigger validation and workflow behaviors
3. Page scrolling and viewport manipulation to reveal lazy-loaded content
4. Modal and popup handling with automatic detection and interaction
5. Navigation menu exploration to discover additional pages and workflows
6. Hover and focus interactions to reveal hidden UI elements and tooltips
7. Interaction logging and rollback capabilities to maintain page state integrity

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement element discovery utilities (AC: 1)
  - [x] Identify clickable elements, inputs, dropdowns using accessible selectors (AC: 1)
- [x] Create safe form interaction routines (AC: 2)
  - [x] Use sample data sets with guardrails against destructive actions (AC: 2)
- [x] Add viewport management (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement scrolling to bottom, mid-page, and targeted elements (AC: 3)
- [x] Handle modals/popups (AC: 4)
  - [x] Detect overlays and close or interact through Playwright selectors (AC: 4)
- [x] Explore navigation menus (AC: 5)
  - [x] Expand menus, collect discovered URLs, and feed them back into discovery pipeline (AC: 5)
- [x] Support hover/focus interactions (AC: 6)
  - [x] Trigger hover/focus events to capture hidden tooltips or menus (AC: 6)
- [x] Log interactions with rollback support (AC: 7)
  - [x] Record actions taken and provide restore mechanism (reload or state reset) (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Enforce the safety constraints outlined in `docs/architecture.md#security`; never submit destructive forms (delete, reset, etc.).
- Persist interaction logs so documentation workflows in `docs/prd.md#epic-4-progress-tracking--documentation-generation` can consume them.
- Structure interaction data so AI navigation features from `docs/prd.md#epic-6-ai-powered-navigation-intelligence-advanced` can extend it.
- Reuse the session utilities established in `docs/stories/2.1.playwright-browser-session-management.md` for reload/reset operations.
- Detect authentication-gated forms and skip them with informative logs, following the guardrails from `docs/architecture.md#security`.
- Seed repeatable sample input data from fixtures managed under `tests/fixtures/` as guided by `docs/architecture.md#test-data-management`, ensuring only sanitized values are used.

### Testing
- Unit tests for interaction helper functions using Playwright's locator testing utilities or mocked selectors.
- Integration tests against sample pages verifying interactions succeed without causing permanent changes.
- Include regression tests ensuring interaction logs capture actions with timestamps and success status.
