# Story 6.4: High-Level Workflow Orchestration Tools

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer using AI development environments,  
**I want** a high-level orchestration tool that combines all existing MCP tools into intelligent workflows,  
**so that** I can perform complete site analysis through natural conversational interactions instead of manually coordinating 15+ individual tools

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single orchestration tool intelligently manages the complete "URL → discovery → analysis → documentation" workflow
2. Tool accepts natural language instructions and translates them into appropriate tool sequences
3. Progress tracking is integrated throughout the orchestrated workflow
4. Error recovery and retry logic work seamlessly across all integrated tools
5. Results are aggregated into comprehensive, actionable documentation
6. Tool supports both interactive and automated modes based on user preference
7. Configuration flows properly through all orchestrated tools (LLM selection, browser settings, etc.)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create main orchestration tool in new `orchestration_tools.py` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement `analyze_legacy_site()` as primary entry point

  - [ ] Provide graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- [ ] Create result aggregation and documentation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Compile analysis results from all tools
  - [ ] Generate comprehensive markdown documentation

## Dev Notes
- Create new file `src/legacy_web_mcp/mcp/orchestration_tools.py` for main implementation
- Reference existing tool implementations in `analysis_tools.py`, `workflow_tools.py`, `browser_tools.py`
- Follow patterns from `SequentialNavigationWorkflow` for state management
- Integrate with progress tracking from Story 4.1 and checkpointing from Story 4.2
- Use configuration management from Stories 1.3, 3.2 for tool settings
- Follow error handling patterns from Story 3.6 for cross-tool error recovery
- Consider async/await patterns for concurrent tool execution where appropriate
- Reference integration specs in `docs/integration-specs/` for architectural guidance
