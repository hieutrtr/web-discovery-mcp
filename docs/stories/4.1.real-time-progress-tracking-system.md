# Story 4.1: Real-Time Progress Tracking System

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to monitor analysis progress in real-time,
**so that** I can understand current status, estimated completion time, and any issues during long-running website analyses

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Progress tracking data structure storing per-page status (pending, analyzing, completed, failed)
2. Real-time progress updates during analysis showing current page, completed count, and percentage
3. Time estimation based on average page processing time and remaining page count
4. MCP resource `analysis_progress` providing live status updates accessible from AI development environments
5. Error tracking and retry count monitoring for failed page analyses
6. Session persistence allowing progress tracking across MCP server restarts
7. Progress logging with timestamps for debugging and performance analysis

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Design `ProgressState` structure capturing per-page status and timestamps (AC: 1,7)
- [ ] Instrument analysis workflow to push status updates and counts in real time (AC: 2)
- [ ] Calculate rolling averages and ETA based on completed page durations (AC: 3)
- [ ] Expose `analysis_progress` MCP resource streaming status updates (AC: 4)
- [ ] Track failures and retry attempts with structured metadata for diagnostics (AC: 5)
- [ ] Persist progress snapshots to disk for restart recovery (AC: 6)
- [ ] Log progress state transitions with timestamps for performance auditing (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Reference data model expectations in `docs/architecture.md#progress-tracking-service` and `docs/architecture.md#project`.
- Follow reporting goals from `docs/prd.md#story-41-real-time-progress-tracking-system` for required metrics.
- Ensure resource exposure aligns with FastMCP patterns in `docs/architecture.md#mcp-protocol-handler`.
- ETAs should consider Step 1/Step 2 timing from `docs/prd.md#story-33-step-1-content-summarization-analysis` and `docs/prd.md#story-34-step-2-detailed-feature-analysis`.
- Log via structlog so diagnostics and documentation processes can reuse telemetry.

### Testing
- Unit test progress calculations, ETA functions, and failure tracking logic with synthetic data.
- Integration test MCP resource ensuring updates stream correctly to client stubs.
- Persistence tests verifying progress resumes correctly after simulated restart.
