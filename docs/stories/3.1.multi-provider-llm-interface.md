# Story 3.1: Multi-Provider LLM Interface

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a unified interface for multiple LLM providers,
**so that** the system can leverage the best models while providing cost optimization and reliability through fallback mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Abstract LLM provider interface supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini APIs
2. Provider-specific implementations with proper authentication and rate limiting
3. Unified request/response format across all providers with consistent error handling
4. API key validation and connectivity testing for each configured provider
5. Request retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
6. Token usage tracking and cost calculation for budget monitoring
7. Provider health monitoring with automatic failover to backup providers

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Design core LLM provider interface covering authentication, request execution, and error handling (AC: 1,3)
- [x] Implement provider adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini with rate limiting hooks (AC: 2)
- [x] Normalize responses into shared schema and propagate structured errors (AC: 3)
- [x] Add API key validation utilities and connectivity diagnostics reused by Story 1.2 (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement retry executor with exponential backoff per architecture error policy (AC: 5)
- [x] Track token usage and estimated costs per request; persist metrics for reporting (AC: 6)
- [x] Monitor provider health, trigger failover decisions, and expose status to diagnostics (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes
- Follow provider facade guidance in `docs/architecture.md#llm-integration-engine` to keep adapters isolated.
- Reuse security practices from `docs/architecture.md#security` for API key handling and storage.
- Reference retry and error taxonomy in `docs/architecture.md#error-handling-strategy` when implementing exponential backoff.
- Expose provider metrics so diagnostics from `docs/stories/1.2.health-check-and-diagnostic-tools.md` can surface availability.
- Align output schema with LLM engine expectations in `docs/prd.md#story-31-multi-provider-llm-interface` for downstream analysis tasks.
