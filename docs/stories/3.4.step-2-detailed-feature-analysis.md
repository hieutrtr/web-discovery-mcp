# Story 3.4: Step 2 - Detailed Feature Analysis

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive feature analysis for each page,
**so that** I can understand all interactive elements, business rules, and technical requirements for rebuilding

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Interactive element analysis identifying forms, buttons, navigation, and user controls with their purposes
2. Functional capability detection for CRUD operations, search, filtering, workflow processes, and state management
3. API integration analysis documenting network requests, data flows, and backend dependencies
4. Business rule extraction including validation logic, conditional behavior, and calculated fields
5. Rebuild specification generation with technical requirements, dependencies, and implementation priorities
6. Integration point identification for third-party services, authentication systems, and external APIs
7. Structured JSON output optimized for development team consumption and project planning

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create Step 2 prompt templates consuming Step 1 context and page artifacts (AC: 1-4)
- [x] Map interactive elements from `docs/stories/2.4.basic-page-interaction-automation.md` and DOM data to LLM input (AC: 1,2)
- [x] Correlate network capture from `docs/stories/2.3.network-traffic-monitoring.md` for API integration insights (AC: 3,6)
- [x] Parse LLM output into `FeatureAnalysis` structure with rebuild requirements (AC: 4,5,7)
- [x] Rank implementation priorities using complexity heuristics and dependencies (AC: 5)
- [x] Document identified third-party integrations and auth flows explicitly (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Align output schema with `docs/architecture.md#featureanalysis` to maintain type fidelity.
- Reference functional expectations in `docs/prd.md#story-34-step-2-detailed-feature-analysis` for coverage.
- Leverage interaction logs and data collected in Epic 2 stories to ground analysis in observed behavior.
- Ensure rebuild requirements tie back to architecture tech stack choices in `docs/architecture.md#tech-stack`.
- Emit structured results for documentation generator described in `docs/prd.md#story-43-structured-documentation-generation`.
