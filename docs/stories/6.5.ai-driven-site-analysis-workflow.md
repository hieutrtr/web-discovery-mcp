# Story 6.5: AI-Driven Site Analysis Workflow

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** developer using AI development environments,  
**I want** an intelligent site analysis workflow that uses AI to orchestrate the complete analysis process,  
**so that** I can get comprehensive legacy application analysis through natural conversation instead of manually coordinating multiple tools

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single conversational command initiates complete site analysis workflow
2. AI intelligently decides analysis scope, depth, and tool selection based on site characteristics
3. Workflow automatically handles common patterns (e-commerce sites, admin panels, content sites, etc.)
4. Progress updates are provided in natural language throughout the analysis
5. Results are synthesized into actionable rebuild recommendations with prioritized findings
6. Tool adapts analysis strategy based on site complexity and user requirements
7. Integration with existing tools maintains all current capabilities while adding intelligence
