# Story 6.5: AI-Driven Site Analysis Workflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer using AI development environments,  
**I want** an intelligent site analysis workflow that uses AI to orchestrate the complete analysis process,  
**so that** I can get comprehensive legacy application analysis through natural conversation instead of manually coordinating multiple tools

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Single conversational command initiates complete site analysis workflow
2. AI intelligently decides analysis scope, depth, and tool selection based on site characteristics
3. Workflow automatically handles common patterns (e-commerce sites, admin panels, content sites, etc.)
4. Progress updates are provided in natural language throughout the analysis
5. Results are synthesized into actionable rebuild recommendations with prioritized findings
6. Tool adapts analysis strategy based on site complexity and user requirements
7. Integration with existing tools maintains all current capabilities while adding intelligence

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create AI-driven workflow orchestrator (AC: 1,2,4)
  - [ ] Implement `intelligent_analyze_site()` as main entry point
  - [ ] Add natural language command parsing and intent recognition
  - [ ] Build AI-driven workflow planning and decision engine
- [ ] Develop site pattern recognition system (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create pattern detectors for common site types (e-commerce, admin, content, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement adaptive analysis strategies for different patterns
  - [ ] Add site complexity assessment and scope adjustment
- [ ] Build intelligent tool selection and sequencing (AC: 2,6)
  - [ ] Analyze site structure to determine optimal tool sequence
  - [ ] Implement dynamic depth adjustment based on page importance
  - [ ] Add user requirement parsing and goal alignment
- [ ] Create natural language progress reporting (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Generate human-readable progress updates
  - [ ] Provide context-aware status messages
  - [ ] Add estimated time remaining in conversational format
- [ ] Implement intelligent result synthesis (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Aggregate analysis results using AI summarization
  - [ ] Generate prioritized rebuild recommendations
  - [ ] Create executive summary with key findings
- [ ] Add adaptive analysis capabilities (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Implement learning from previous analyses
  - [ ] Add feedback loop for analysis quality improvement
  - [ ] Support custom analysis templates and strategies
- [ ] Ensure seamless integration with existing ecosystem (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Leverage existing orchestration tools from Story 6.4
  - [ ] Maintain compatibility with current tool interfaces
  - [ ] Preserve all existing functionality and options

## Dev Notes
- Build on top of Story 6.4 orchestration tools for base functionality
- Use LLM capabilities for intelligent decision-making and planning
- Leverage existing pattern recognition from browser automation tools
- Integrate with progress tracking from Story 4.1 for status updates
- Follow natural language generation patterns similar to Story 5.1 interactive mode
- Use configuration management from Stories 1.3, 3.2 for AI model selection
- Consider using meta-prompting techniques for workflow planning
- Reference existing analysis patterns in `docs/integration-specs/workflow-orchestration-spec.md`
