# Story 1.1: MCP Server Project Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize a new MCP server project with proper Python 3.11 structure and FastMCP framework,
**so that** I have a solid foundation for building the legacy web analysis tool.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Python 3.11 project structure created with proper package organization
2. FastMCP framework integrated and basic MCP server responds to ping requests
3. Development environment setup with linting, formatting, and basic testing framework
4. Git repository initialized with appropriate .gitignore and README
5. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing
6. Environment variable template created for configuration management

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Scaffold Python 3.11 project structure (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create source package layout following modular monolith organization (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Configure `pyproject.toml` with project metadata and dependencies (AC: 1)
- [ ] Integrate FastMCP framework and ping handler (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Install FastMCP 2.12.0 and wire basic server entrypoint (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement `ping` tool/resource responding successfully (AC: 2)
- [ ] Configure development tooling (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Add ruff formatting/linting and mypy type checking configuration (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Configure pytest + pytest-asyncio with initial placeholder test (AC: 3)
- [ ] Initialize repository assets (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add `.gitignore` aligned with Python, Playwright, MCP artifacts (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Draft README with project overview and setup instructions (AC: 4)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow running lint, type check, and tests (AC: 5)
- [ ] Provide environment variable template (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add `.env.template` covering LLM keys and configuration (AC: 6)

## Dev Notes
- Use Python 3.11 with AsyncIO-ready project layout per `docs/architecture.md#high-level-architecture` and the modular monolith guidance.
- Adopt FastMCP protocol handler as entrypoint with tool/resource registration aligned to the diagrams in `docs/architecture.md#high-level-project-diagram`.
- Align dependency versions with the tech stack table (`docs/architecture.md#tech-stack`) even if initial implementations are stubs.
- Configure structlog-based logging and async readiness following `docs/architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns`.
- Document uv/uvx workflow details from `docs/architecture.md#deployment--distribution` in the README for local execution parity.

### Testing
- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/` mirroring package modules; integration tests not required yet but keep structure ready.
- Use pytest with pytest-asyncio; follow AAA structure and mock external dependencies.
- Ensure GitHub Actions workflow runs lint (`ruff`), type checks (`mypy`), and tests (`pytest`).
