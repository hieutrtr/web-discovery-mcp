# Story 4.5: Incremental Documentation Updates

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the analysis report to be updated after each page analysis completes,
**so that** I can review results progressively without waiting for the entire analysis to finish

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Master analysis report file updated immediately after each page analysis completion
2. New page section appended to `<project>/docs/web_discovery/analysis-report.md` with proper formatting
3. Table of contents automatically updated to include newly analyzed pages
4. Progress summary section showing completed vs. remaining pages with timestamps
5. Consistent markdown formatting maintained across incremental updates
6. File integrity protection ensuring readable output during concurrent updates
7. Summary statistics updated (total pages analyzed, features discovered, APIs identified)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Trigger incremental report updates at end of each page workflow (AC: 1)
- [ ] Append formatted page section using templates shared with Story 4.3 (AC: 2,5)
- [ ] Regenerate or update TOC entries without duplicating anchors (AC: 3)
- [ ] Refresh summary section with counts and timestamps from progress tracker (AC: 4,7)
- [ ] Guard file writes with locking or transactional updates to prevent corruption (AC: 6)
- [ ] Ensure formatting helpers keep markdown consistent across runs (AC: 5)

## Dev Notes
- Extend documentation generator from `docs/stories/4.3.structured-documentation-generation.md` for incremental writes.
- Use progress data from `docs/stories/4.1.real-time-progress-tracking-system.md` to populate summaries.
- Respect storage locations defined in `docs/stories/4.4.mcp-artifact-organization-and-file-management.md`.
- Implement safe write patterns from the file-based storage guidance in `docs/architecture.md#architectural-and-design-patterns`.
- Ensure incremental updates remain performant to support NFR timing targets in `docs/prd.md#non-functional-requirements`.

### Testing
- Unit test incremental update functions to confirm idempotent section appends and TOC refresh.
- Simulate concurrent updates to validate locking/transaction safeguards.
- Regression test summary statistics formatting with snapshot comparisons.
