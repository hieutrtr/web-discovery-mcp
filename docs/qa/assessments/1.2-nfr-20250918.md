# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 1.2 (2025-09-18)

| NFR            | Status     | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Security       | PASS       | Diagnostics avoid logging secrets; env validator enforces key presence once bug fixed; no new network endpoints beyond authenticated LLM probes. |
| Performance    | CONCERNS   | LLM connectivity checks run sequential HTTP GETs with 5s timeout; under offline scenarios diagnostics may block ~15s without backoff/short-circuit. Consider parallelism or faster failure strategy. |
| Reliability    | FAIL       | Missing-env flow raises `AttributeError` due to `EnvIssue` serialization bug, causing health check to crash (AC5/AC6). |
| Maintainability| CONCERNS   | Core happy-path tests exist, but no regression covering missing-env branch; remediation guidance depends on fragile serialization. |

### Observations & Recommendations

- **Security:** Continue to guard API keys; ensure structlog context excludes secrets when additional metadata is logged.
- **Performance:** Consider asyncio.gather for LLM probes and configurable timeout/skip to avoid compounded latency.
- **Reliability:** Fix `EnvIssue` serialization (`dataclasses.asdict`) and add unit coverage for missing env vars before promoting.
- **Maintainability:** Add targeted tests and consider docstring on diagnostics module summarizing tool outputs for future contributors.
