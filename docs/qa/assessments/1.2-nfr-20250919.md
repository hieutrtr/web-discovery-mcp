# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 1.2 (2025-09-19)

| NFR            | Status     | Notes |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Security       | PASS       | Secrets redacted in `display_dict`; diagnostics avoid logging key material; env validation ensures presence without emitting values. |
| Performance    | CONCERNS   | Sequential LLM probes still wait up to 5s each; acceptable but monitor for compounded latency under outages. |
| Reliability    | PASS       | Missing-env path now returns remediation payload (validated by `test_missing_env_vars_reported`), preventing diagnostic crashes. |
| Maintainability| PASS       | Added regression tests for settings/loader; configuration surfaces centralized via `MCPSettings` & `show_config` tool. |

### Observations & Recommendations

- Consider parallelizing LLM probes or adding configurable max runtime to limit impact during provider downtime (Performance CONCERNS).
- Reliability and maintainability improved with new tests and simplified helpers; continue adding integration coverage when remote probes change.

NFR gate block:

```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Secrets redacted; env validation enforces presence.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Sequential LLM probes may take ~15s when providers unreachable; consider parallelism/timeout tweaks.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Env validation returns remediation instead of raising; diagnostics stable.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Configuration logic covered by unit tests; show_config tool provides quick visibility.'
```
