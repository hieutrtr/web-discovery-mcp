## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                      | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| PERF-001 | Large page content memory usage  | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| OPS-001  | Screenshot storage growth        | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk Analysis

### PERF-001: Large Page Content Memory Usage

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Most pages have manageable content size, extraction is efficient
**Impact**: Medium - Very large pages could cause memory pressure during extraction

**Mitigation**:
- Configurable timeout limits prevent runaway page loads
- Visible text cleanup reduces memory footprint
- Content size calculation helps monitor resource usage
- Screenshot capture is optional and configurable

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test navigation with large content pages (>10MB HTML)
- Verify memory usage during content extraction
- Test timeout handling with slow-loading content

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Well-controlled with existing safeguards

### OPS-001: Screenshot Storage Growth

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Screenshots are optional, organized by timestamp
**Impact**: Medium - Could consume significant disk space over time

**Mitigation**:
- Screenshots stored in organized analysis/screenshots/ structure
- Timestamp-based naming prevents collisions
- Project-based organization enables targeted cleanup
- Screenshot capture is configurable and can be disabled

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test screenshot storage patterns over time
- Verify file naming collision prevention
- Test cleanup integration with project management

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Good organization and configurable capture

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Performance Testing
- Test navigation with various page sizes and content types
- Monitor memory usage during content extraction
- Verify timeout handling effectiveness
- Test screenshot capture performance impact

### Priority 2: Storage Management Testing
- Test screenshot storage organization and naming
- Verify content size calculation accuracy
- Test cleanup workflows for old analysis data

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Ready for Production
All identified risks are low-severity with appropriate mitigations in place.

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-001: Large page memory usage - Acceptable with current timeout and cleanup mechanisms
- OPS-001: Screenshot storage growth - Acceptable with project-based organization and configurable capture

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Page navigation success/failure rates by content size
- Screenshot storage usage patterns
- Content extraction performance metrics
- Timeout occurrence frequency

## Risk Review Triggers

Review this risk profile when:
- Adding support for very large content pages (>50MB)
- Implementing automated screenshot capture
- Adding video or animated content capture
- Modifying content extraction algorithms

## Overall Assessment

This is a very low-risk implementation with excellent navigation and extraction capabilities. The identified risks have appropriate mitigations and are well within acceptable bounds. The implementation demonstrates careful consideration of performance and storage concerns while providing comprehensive functionality.

## Strengths

1. **Robust Navigation**: Comprehensive retry mechanisms and error handling
2. **Efficient Extraction**: Optimized content processing with memory awareness
3. **Organized Storage**: Well-structured screenshot and content organization
4. **Configurable Behavior**: Timeout, retry, and capture options provide flexibility
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Excellent test coverage with realistic scenarios

## Future Considerations

- Monitor content size trends as websites become more complex
- Consider implementing content streaming for very large pages
- Evaluate need for screenshot compression or optimization
- Review storage cleanup automation opportunities
