## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                      | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| DATA-001 | Storage space exhaustion         | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk Analysis

### DATA-001: Storage Space Exhaustion

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Typical analysis projects have modest storage requirements
**Impact**: Medium - Could prevent new project creation when disk space is full

**Mitigation**:
- Archive functionality provides space management capability
- Delete functionality allows permanent cleanup
- Project listing helps identify candidates for cleanup
- Confirmation requirements prevent accidental data loss

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test archive functionality works correctly
- Verify delete operations clean up completely
- Test project listing performance with many projects

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Well-controlled with existing cleanup utilities

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Data Management Testing
- Test storage operations under various filesystem conditions
- Verify cleanup utilities work correctly
- Test project listing with large numbers of projects
- Confirm archive and delete operations are complete

### Priority 2: Edge Case Testing
- Test behavior with corrupted metadata files
- Verify handling of missing directories
- Test concurrent access patterns (future consideration)

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Ready for Production
All identified risks are low-severity with appropriate mitigations in place.

### Accepted Risks
- DATA-001: Storage exhaustion - Acceptable with current cleanup utilities and monitoring

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Disk space usage trends
- Project creation and cleanup patterns
- Storage operation error rates
- Archive/delete operation success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review this risk profile when:
- Adding automated cleanup policies
- Implementing storage quotas
- Scaling to multi-user environments
- Adding cloud storage backends

## Overall Assessment

This is a very low-risk implementation with excellent defensive programming. The single identified risk has appropriate mitigations and is well within acceptable bounds for the current use case. The implementation demonstrates careful consideration of data safety and operational concerns.
