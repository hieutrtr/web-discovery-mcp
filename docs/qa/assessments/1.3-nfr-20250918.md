# NFR Assessment â€“ Story 1.3 (2025-09-18)

| NFR            | Status | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Security       | PASS   | `MCPSettings.display_dict()` redacts all secrets; diagnostics validator logs keys without values; `.env.template` keeps sensitive inputs out of version control. |
| Performance    | PASS   | Configuration objects are lightweight; file overrides only parse small YAML/JSON files on demand; no additional synchronous network calls introduced. |
| Reliability    | PASS   | Validator returns structured remediation instead of raising; loader falls back cleanly when config file absent; health check exercised in tests. |
| Maintainability| PASS   | Configuration responsibility centralized in `legacy_web_mcp.config`; tests cover settings, loader, and diagnostics flows; README documents configuration pathways. |

### Observations & Recommendations

- Monitor the cost of reloading configuration on every tool invocation; if future stories add heavier parsing, consider memoization.
- Document recommended precedence (env vs. file) in architecture notes to avoid ambiguity for future contributors.

NFR gate block:

```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Secrets redacted via display_dict; diagnostics never echo API keys.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Configuration loading is in-memory and uses small YAML/JSON files; no hot-path penalties observed.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Validator returns remediation payloads and tests cover missing-key cases.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Config logic consolidated under legacy_web_mcp.config with regression tests and README guidance.'
```
