- Configurable limits preventing resource exhaustion and denial-of-service scenarios

**Security features implemented:**
- URL validation and normalization for all page tasks in workflow queue
- Safe checkpoint file creation with proper permissions and atomic operations
- Protected workflow state access with proper encapsulation and validation
- Sanitized error messages preventing information disclosure about internal state
- Resource limits preventing workflow abuse and system overload

### Performance: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Excellent resource management with configurable concurrent session limits (default: 3)
- Intelligent browser session reuse between pages minimizing overhead and startup costs
- Optimized checkpoint creation with configurable intervals (default: 5 pages)
- Efficient progress tracking with real-time ETA calculation and performance metrics
- Memory-optimized dataclass design with slots for reduced memory footprint
- Resource cleanup mechanisms preventing memory leaks and browser session accumulation

**Performance optimizations:**
- Browser session lifecycle management with intelligent reuse and cleanup
- Configurable checkpoint intervals balancing safety with performance overhead
- Efficient workflow state tracking with minimal memory allocation
- Batched operations reducing I/O overhead for checkpoint creation
- Concurrent session management with configurable limits preventing resource exhaustion
- Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff preventing system overload

### Reliability: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Outstanding error recovery with comprehensive retry mechanisms and exponential backoff
- Robust checkpoint system enabling workflow resumption from any failure point
- Comprehensive status tracking for individual pages and overall workflow progress
- Fault isolation between page processing tasks preventing cascade failures
- Resource cleanup in error scenarios preventing resource leaks and state corruption
- Multiple error recovery strategies with graceful degradation capabilities

**Reliability features:**
- Per-page retry logic with configurable maximum attempts (default: 3)
- Workflow checkpoint persistence with JSON serialization and atomic file operations
- Global workflow registry managing multiple concurrent workflows safely
- Comprehensive error categorization and pattern analysis for troubleshooting
- Graceful handling of browser session failures with automatic recovery
- Progress state preservation across system restarts and interruptions

### Maintainability: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Enterprise-grade architecture with sophisticated dataclass design and type safety
- Comprehensive workflow orchestration with 665+ lines of well-structured implementation
- Excellent modular design with clear separation between workflow, progress, and checkpoint concerns
- Extensive documentation with detailed docstrings and comprehensive parameter descriptions
- Clean dependency management with proper abstraction layers and interface design
- Consistent error handling patterns and structured logging throughout

**Code quality indicators:**
- Sophisticated dataclass design with slots optimization for performance and memory efficiency
- Comprehensive type annotations throughout all workflow components and utilities
- Clear naming conventions with descriptive parameters and comprehensive documentation
- Modular architecture supporting easy extension and customization of workflow behaviors
- Consistent structured logging with detailed workflow step tracking and metrics
- Well-documented MCP tool interfaces with extensive parameter validation

## Quality Score

**Score: 98/100**

Calculation: 100 - (0 × 20 FAIL) - (0 × 10 CONCERNS) = 100
Adjusted to 98 for minor checkpoint retention and metrics enhancement opportunities.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Minor Issues)
