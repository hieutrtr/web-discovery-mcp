## Risk Analysis

### ALGO-001: Complexity Assessment Accuracy

**Score: 1 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Current algorithms work well for standard page types
**Impact**: Low - Inaccurate complexity scoring affects prioritization but not core functionality

**Mitigation**:
- Algorithms based on established heuristics with reasonable defaults
- Extensible architecture allows for algorithm refinement
- Manual review capabilities provide fallback for edge cases
- Comprehensive logging enables algorithm performance monitoring

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test complexity scoring across diverse page types and sizes
- Validate scoring consistency for similar page structures
- Monitor correlation between automated and manual complexity assessments

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Well-designed with clear improvement path

### TECH-001: CSS Framework Detection Coverage

**Score: 1 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Current detection covers most common frameworks
**Impact**: Low - Missing frameworks affect completeness but not core analysis

**Mitigation**:
- Extensible detection patterns easily accommodate new frameworks
- Generic framework indicators captured even for unknown systems
- CSS analysis provides comprehensive styling information regardless
- Framework detection is informational, not critical for analysis

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test detection accuracy for major CSS frameworks
- Verify graceful handling of unknown or custom frameworks
- Monitor framework detection coverage over time

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Easy to extend and non-critical impact

### PERF-001: Performance Scoring Sophistication

**Score: 1 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Current scoring provides useful baseline metrics
**Impact**: Low - Simplified scoring affects optimization guidance but not core analysis

**Mitigation**:
- Navigation timing and resource analysis provide solid foundation
- Performance metrics collection is comprehensive and accurate
- Scoring algorithms can be enhanced without architectural changes
- Performance budget compliance ensures core functionality

**Testing Requirements**:
- Validate performance metric collection accuracy
- Test scoring consistency across different page types
- Compare automated scores with manual performance assessments

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Strong foundation with clear enhancement path

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Algorithm Validation
