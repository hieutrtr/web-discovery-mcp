## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                      | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Type safety issues with Playwright | Low (1)   | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: Type Safety Issues with Playwright Browser Launch

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Issues are cosmetic and don't affect runtime behavior
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause confusion during development and CI/CD type checking

**Mitigation**:
- Type launch_options more precisely in session.py:207-219
- Add proper type annotations for Playwright browser launch parameters
- Update mypy configuration if needed for Playwright compatibility
- Fix null safety checks in service.py:91, 277

**Testing Requirements**:
- Verify type checking passes with stricter mypy settings
- Test browser launching with various option combinations
- Validate error handling for invalid browser configurations

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Type safety improvements are straightforward

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Browser Compatibility Testing
- Test all three browser engines (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Verify session creation and cleanup across engines
- Test concurrency limits under various load conditions

### Priority 2: Edge Case Testing
- Test crash recovery mechanisms with simulated failures
- Verify resource cleanup under abnormal termination
- Test concurrent session limits and queue management

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Ready for Production
All identified risks are low-severity with clear remediation paths. The implementation demonstrates excellent defensive programming practices.

### Accepted Risks
- TECH-001: Type safety improvements - Acceptable for current functionality, can be addressed in maintenance

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Browser session success/failure rates
- Memory usage patterns over time
- Crash recovery effectiveness
- Concurrency limit utilization

## Risk Review Triggers

Review this risk profile when:
- Upgrading Playwright versions (API changes possible)
- Adding support for additional browser engines
- Modifying concurrency control algorithms
- Implementing memory usage monitoring features

## Overall Assessment

This is an exceptionally low-risk implementation with excellent architecture and defensive programming. The single identified risk is minor and easily addressable. The implementation demonstrates mature understanding of browser automation challenges and provides robust solutions for session management, concurrency control, and error recovery.

## Strengths

1. **Robust Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper exception hierarchy and recovery mechanisms
3. **Resource Management**: Excellent cleanup patterns preventing memory leaks
4. **Concurrency Control**: Proper AsyncIO semaphore usage with configurable limits
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics collection for operational visibility
6. **Testing**: High test coverage (92%) with proper mocking strategies

## Future Considerations

- Monitor Playwright API evolution for potential breaking changes
- Consider adding browser session persistence for service restart scenarios
- Evaluate need for custom browser profiles or extensions support
