## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                      | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| PERF-001 | Large site crawling performance  | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| OPS-001  | Concurrent project conflicts     | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  |

## Risk Analysis

### PERF-001: Large Site Crawling Performance

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Most sites have manageable structure, depth limits prevent runaway crawling
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause slow discovery on extremely large sites (>50,000 pages)

**Mitigation**:
- Configurable depth limits already implemented (DISCOVERY_MAX_DEPTH)
- Timeout protection in place (DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT)
- Progress reporting provides user feedback
- AsyncIO concurrent fetching optimizes performance

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Well-controlled with existing safeguards

### OPS-001: Concurrent Project Conflicts

**Score: 1 (Minimal)**
**Probability**: Low - File-based storage with domain-based project IDs reduces collisions
**Impact**: Low - Worst case is overwriting discovery data for same domain

**Mitigation**:
- Domain-based project ID generation prevents most conflicts
- File timestamps provide conflict detection
- JSON/YAML format allows easy manual recovery

**Residual Risk**: Negligible - Acceptable for current use case

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Performance Testing
- Test discovery on sites with 1000+ pages
- Verify timeout handling works correctly
- Confirm depth limits prevent unbounded crawling
- Monitor memory usage during large crawls

### Priority 2: Operational Testing
- Test concurrent discovery operations on different domains
- Verify project storage isolation works correctly
- Test error handling for network failures

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Ready for Production
All identified risks are low-severity and have appropriate mitigations in place.

### Accepted Risks
- PERF-001: Large site performance - Acceptable with current depth limits and timeouts
- OPS-001: Concurrent operations - Acceptable for single-user MCP tool usage

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Discovery operation timing (PERF-001)
- Storage conflicts or errors (OPS-001)
- Memory usage during large crawls
- Network timeout occurrences

## Risk Review Triggers

Review this risk profile when:
- Adding multi-user support (increases OPS-001 probability)
- Removing depth limits or timeouts (increases PERF-001 impact)
- Integrating with external rate-limited APIs
- Adding persistent session management

## Overall Assessment

This is a low-risk implementation with excellent quality. All identified risks have appropriate mitigations and monitoring. The implementation demonstrates defensive programming practices and proper resource management.
