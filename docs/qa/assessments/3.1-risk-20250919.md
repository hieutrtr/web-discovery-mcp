## Risk Analysis

### HEALTH-001: Provider Health Validation Granularity

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Current health monitoring provides solid foundation for availability tracking
**Impact**: Low - Enhanced validation would improve diagnostics but core functionality is robust

**Mitigation**:
- Existing health monitoring tracks response times and error rates effectively
- Provider initialization includes basic connectivity validation
- Automatic failover mechanisms provide robust error recovery
- Comprehensive error categorization supports troubleshooting
- Health status exposed through diagnostic interfaces for monitoring

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test provider health monitoring accuracy under various failure scenarios
- Validate failover effectiveness when providers become unhealthy
- Monitor health check performance overhead and accuracy

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Solid foundation with clear enhancement opportunities

### COST-001: Cost Calculation Sophistication

**Score: 1 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Current cost calculation provides accurate baseline tracking
**Impact**: Low - Enhanced pricing would improve optimization but core tracking is functional

**Mitigation**:
- Token usage tracking accurately captures consumption metrics
- Provider-specific pricing models provide baseline cost calculation
- Budget monitoring supports spending control and alerting
- Cost tracking integrated with usage analytics for reporting
- Extensible cost calculation architecture supports enhancement

**Testing Requirements**:
- Validate cost calculation accuracy across different usage patterns
- Test budget monitoring effectiveness with various spending scenarios
- Monitor cost tracking overhead and performance impact

**Residual Risk**: Minimal - Accurate foundation with clear optimization path

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Provider Reliability
- Test multi-provider failover scenarios with comprehensive failure simulation
- Validate health monitoring accuracy and failover trigger conditions
- Test provider recovery and reactivation after outage resolution

### Priority 2: Cost and Performance
- Test cost calculation accuracy across different providers and usage patterns
- Validate performance optimization under various load conditions
- Test resource management effectiveness during extended operations

## Risk Acceptance Criteria
