## Assessment Details

### Security: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Secure DOM evaluation using Playwright's sandboxed JavaScript execution
- Proper input validation and URL sanitization throughout analysis pipeline
- Safe handling of external stylesheets with cross-origin access protection
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials in analysis components
- Structured error logging without sensitive data exposure
- Configurable payload size limits preventing resource exhaustion attacks

**Security features implemented:**
- URL validation and normalization using secure parsing
- Safe DOM traversal with element count limits and timeout protections
- Protected CSS rule access with exception handling for cross-origin resources
- Sanitized error messages preventing information disclosure
- Configurable resource limits preventing denial-of-service scenarios

### Performance: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Configurable performance budget with 120-second default compliance
- Efficient resource management with selective analysis component enabling
- Optimized network request limiting (50 requests max) for performance
- Streamlined DOM analysis with batched element queries
- Memory-efficient data structures with proper cleanup and garbage collection
- Performance timing collection and analysis for optimization opportunities

**Performance optimizations:**
- Modular analysis architecture allowing selective feature enabling
- Efficient JavaScript evaluation with single-pass DOM traversal
- Resource-aware network monitoring with configurable payload limits
- Smart interaction simulation with configurable interaction limits (20 max)
- Optimized JSON serialization for LLM processing efficiency
- Browser session reuse and proper resource cleanup

### Reliability: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation per analysis component
- Robust timeout handling for all external operations (page loads, network monitoring)
- Fault isolation between analysis components preventing cascade failures
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Resource cleanup in error scenarios preventing resource leaks
- Comprehensive status tracking and error categorization

**Reliability features:**
- Per-component error isolation with independent failure handling
- Configurable timeout and retry strategies for network operations
- Graceful handling of cross-origin stylesheet access failures
- Safe framework detection with exception handling for missing globals
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting and performance monitoring
- Browser session state preservation across analysis steps

### Maintainability: PASS

**Evidence:**
- Outstanding modular design with clear separation of concerns across 9 analysis components
- Comprehensive Pydantic models providing complete type safety and validation
- Well-structured 829-line implementation with excellent code organization
- Extensive documentation with detailed docstrings and usage examples
- Clean dependency management with proper abstraction layers
- Consistent error handling patterns and logging strategies

**Code quality indicators:**
- Comprehensive type annotations throughout all analysis components
- Clear class and method naming conventions with descriptive parameters
- Modular architecture supporting easy extension and customization
- Consistent error handling with structured exception management
- Comprehensive configuration options with sensible defaults
- Well-documented MCP tool interfaces with detailed parameter descriptions

## Quality Score

**Score: 97/100**

Calculation: 100 - (0 × 20 FAIL) - (0 × 10 CONCERNS) = 100
Adjusted to 97 for minor algorithm calibration opportunities and framework detection extensibility.

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Minor Issues)
- Calibrate complexity assessment algorithms using larger page dataset
- Extend CSS framework detection patterns for additional frameworks
