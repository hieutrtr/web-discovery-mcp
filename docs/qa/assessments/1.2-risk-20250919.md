## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Description                                                                  | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| OPS-001 | External network probes can slow diagnostics under offline conditions         | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium   |

## Risk Register

### OPS-001 – Network probe latency/failures
- **Category:** Operational
- **Description:** LLM connectivity checks perform live HTTP requests; outages or firewall rules could delay tool responses.
- **Status:** Mitigated by 5s timeout and remediation messaging. Recommend optional parallel execution or skip when offline.
- **Actions:** Monitor probe duration; consider configurable timeout/parallelization in future iterations.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

- Continue unit coverage of missing-key path (already added).
- Future integration test could simulate HTTP timeout to verify graceful degradation but not required for sign-off.
