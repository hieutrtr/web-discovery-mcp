  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: Secrets redacted; env validation enforces presence.
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: Sequential LLM probes may take ~15s when providers unreachable; consider
      parallelism/timeout tweaks.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Env validation returns remediation instead of raising exceptions.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Configuration helpers covered by unit tests; show_config tool gives visibility.
