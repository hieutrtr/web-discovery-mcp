    title: Secrets absent in deployment environments
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
    - Automate deployment checks for mandatory STEP/LLM env keys.
    monitor:
    - Add secret-scanning guardrails for config overrides (SEC-001).
nfr_validation:
  _assessed:
  - security
  - performance
  - reliability
  - maintainability
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: Secrets redacted via `display_dict`; diagnostics never echo API keys.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Configuration loads are in-memory and parse small files only when requested.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Validator returns structured remediation for missing keys; loader falls back cleanly.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Config modules centralized under `legacy_web_mcp.config` with regression coverage.
