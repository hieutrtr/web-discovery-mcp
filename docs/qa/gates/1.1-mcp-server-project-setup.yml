  uncovered:
  - ac: AC1
    reason: Only manual verification of package layout; automated guard pending (see
      test scenario 1.1-UNIT-001).
  - ac: AC3
    reason: Tooling commands verified manually; add integration smoke to automate
      (scenario 1.1-INT-003).
  - ac: AC4
    reason: No automated check for .gitignore / README contents.
  - ac: AC5
    reason: CI workflow not validated in automated tests (scenario 1.1-INT-005).
  - ac: AC6
    reason: Environment template keys lack unit test (scenario 1.1-UNIT-003).
