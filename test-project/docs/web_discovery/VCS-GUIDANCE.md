# Version Control Guidance for Web Discovery

## Overview
This document provides guidance for managing web discovery analysis files in version control.

## Recommended Approach

### Include in Version Control
- `docs/web_discovery/analysis-metadata.json` - Project metadata and progress tracking
- `docs/web_discovery/pages/page-*.md` - Individual page analysis files
- `docs/web_discovery/analysis-report.md` - Master analysis report (if not too large)

### Consider Excluding
- `docs/web_discovery/progress/` - Progress tracking files (change frequently)
- Large report files that can be regenerated from artifacts

### Team Collaboration
- Page analysis files provide valuable context for developers
- Metadata file helps track overall project analysis status
- Master report can be regenerated as needed

## Git Configuration Applied
The following rules have been found in .gitignore:

```gitignore
# Web Discovery Analysis Files
# Generated by Legacy Web MCP Server

# Exclude progress tracking files (frequently changing)
docs/web_discovery/progress/
# Keep metadata and page analyses (valuable for team)
!docs/web_discovery/analysis-metadata.json
!docs/web_discovery/pages/

# Exclude temporary analysis files
*.analysis-temp
*.artifact-backup
```
